## Description

This is a second module in a bootcamp, design to show a students understanding of flex, and css psudo-selectors. As I achieve a greater understanding of flexbox and selectors. I plan to return to this project to rebuild everything I've done here to a more profesisonal standard. 


## Installation

This can be ran in VS Code or your preferred coding software. 

## Usage

The best way to observe the code in action is to open the console in your browser and play with the settings.
